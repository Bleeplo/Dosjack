# Dosjack
A terminal based game about the gambling game black jack.

This is a script I worked up in the free time I had. It isn't fully black jack but rather a very elementary version of it.
Future additions is planned but unconfirmed.

**This is mainly built for Linux** 

To run the executible, open up the terminal in the directory and type ./Dosjack
If running python(3), then python3 script.py
